### Reporting Bugs
Before creating bug reports, please check the bug list(#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible(#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report)

### Suggesting Enhancements
This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Cheaper, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. 


### Pull Request Process
1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

Please check existing bug reports instead of opening a new one. There is a possibility that there are fixes already posted for bugs. If not, you are welcome to submit a bug report and we will look into it as soon as possible.

#### Git Branching Naming Convention
Not using appropriate naming conventions leads to confusion and complicates the code maintenance team. We can’t ignore Git best practices in branching naming conventions.

- Main (main) is the default branch available in the Git repository. It should be stable all the time and won’t allow any direct check-in. You can only merge it after code review. All team members are responsible for keeping the master stable and up-to-date.

- <b>Make sure the new branch you create follows proper naming conventions.</b>
```<author>-<date in (DD-MMMM) format>-<short-feature-description>```
<br> E.g., rahil-6-sept-test-badge
E.g., moksh-7-sept-web-scraping

This method allows for easy tracking of different developers’ work and progress with additional systems.
